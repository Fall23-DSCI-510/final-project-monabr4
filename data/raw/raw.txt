Data Cleaning 

Step 1: COVID-19 (Malaysia)State Level Cases were extracted from an API:

Covid Cases By State: https://covid-19.samsam123.name.my/api.html


Steph 2: The loading_to_csv.ipynb contains the code from the API extraction.
 Upon extraction and cleaning, the data was converted into a CSV file for data analysis. 

 Below are the CSV files that were made. These files are stored raw>exported_statis_csv_shapefile>STATES_CSV :

    - Johor.csv 
    - Kedah.csv
    - Kelantan.csv
    - Melaka.csv
    - Negeri_Sembilan.csv
    - Pahang.csv
    - Perak.csv
    - Perlis.csv
    - Pulau Pinang.csv
    - Sabah.csv
    - Sarawak.csv
    - Selangor.csv
    - Terengganu.csv
    - W_P_Kuala Lumpur.csv
    - W_P_Labuan.csv **** REMOVED because this state was not in the shapefile.
    - W_P_Putrajaya.csv


All CSV files above were merged to get the total COVID-19 in Malaysia cases by state
between January 25, 2020 to January 25, 2023 in the merged_sate_data.ipynb. The data cleaning process includes mutating columns,
changing column names, and merging data. The merged data is stored as final_covid_data.csv.

The final_covid_data.csv can be located: data>processed>final_covid_data.csv

Step 3: Merging Spatial Data 

Population of Malaysia: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/16605343/Tzm8GG7u
The population of Malaysia was extracted through an API. It was exported into a csv file called cleaned_population_data.csv.

Malaysia ShapeFile: https://cartographyvectors.com/map/1477-malaysia-with-regions
The shapefile was extracted in the "loading_shapefile.ipynb". It was exported as[static]malaysia.geojson.

Changes to these files: 
- Column name changes 
- Rates were calculated as (# of new cases)/ (total state population)

Shapefiles and CSV files were merged in the merged_state_data.ipynb to create final_rate_data.geojson.


The cleaned filed are located data>processed
- final_covid_data.csv
- final_rate_data.geojson 

Further information on the cleaned (ready for processing) files can be found in processed.txt.
