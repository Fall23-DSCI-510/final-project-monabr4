covid_percentage_by_state.png: Percentage of COVID-19 Cases by State and Age Group
Age is classified as Child → 12  and under | Adolescent → 13-17 | Adult → 18-59  | Elderly →  60+ 
Findings: The states are ranked (bottom to top) from most populated state to the least populated state.
The most populated state is Selangor with 11.6% of the new covid cases are children, 5.7% are adolescents,
75.6% are adults and 7% are the elderly. The least populated state is W.P. Putrajaya with 16.6% of the new
covid cases being children, 6.5% being adolescent, 73.5% being adults, and 3.4% being elderly. The least
populated state has the lowest percentage of new cases infecting the elder population.

interactive_new_cases_by_state.html: COVID-19 Cases Over Time for Each State
Since this is an interactive plot (plotly), the states can be selected to view the relationship of COVID-19 
cases over time for each state. Between  January 25, 2020 to January 25, 2023, there seems to be 2 major peaks. 
The first major peak August 6, 2021 with reported  8792 new cases and the second peak March 24, 2022 with 
reported  11,622 new cases. These two peaks happen in Selangor. After  September 6, 2020,  the number of reported
 new Covid cases started to increase rapidly. This could be due to several reasons: testing availability, people
  avoiding the hospital,miss information around Covid. By May 2023, the number of new cases started to drop. 
  This could be due to lower testing rates.

recovered_rate_map.html: COVID-19 Information
This is a static image of the recovered_rate_map.html. The interactive map can be used to see each state's name, 
total cases, total recovered cases, percent recovered, and percent not recovered. Since death data is not included, 
the percent not recovered can be due to death or  lost to follow up. According to the visualization, 1.9% (highest
percent not recovered) of those total Covid cases in Melaka did not recover. About 0.54% of the people in Kelantan
did not recover from Covid. W.P Kuala Lumpur, the capital, is surrounded by the most populous state Selangor (makes up
 20.02% of the population in Malaysia). Their recovery rate of  0.73% is average among other states.

covid_plot_diagnostics.png: residual vs. fitted plot and QQ-plot
The residual vs. fitted graph and Q-Q plot suggest that there is a violation of assumptions. There are also only 13 data points.
 Non-parametric tests should be used. Spearman’s Correlation is a measure of association between for nonparametric data.

scatter_plot: Population Density vs. COVID-19 Transmission Rate by state
The spearman's correlation coefficient between population density and COVID transmission rate is approximately -0.2071 (p-value = 0.4588).
There is a weak negative correlation between the two variables. Given the p-value is greater than 0.05, the correlation
is not statically significant. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that the observed correlation is different from 0.
Population density is not a strong predictor of COVID-19 transmission rates. Further investigation is needed to understand 
the relationship between population density an COVID transmission rates. 

    Spearman's Correlation Results:
    Spearman's Correlation Coefficient: -0.2071428571428571
    P-value: 0.4588428049634703
    The relationship is not statistically significant.

Conclusion:

The examination of COVID-19 cases across different age groups showed patterns, with populous states like Selangor showcasing high covid cases among adults.
Selangor is the state that surrounds the state of W.P. Kuala Lumpur (the capital). Meanwhile, W.P. Putrajaya, the least populated state, exhibits a lower
impact on the elderly population. The interactive plot tracking incidence rates reveals high covid rates in Selangor. Moreover, an analysis of disparities 
in recoveries across states shows regional differences, with Melaka showcasing a higher percentage of cases not recovered. For those who did not recover, 
it is hard to tell if those people were lost to follow up or had died due to the Covid infection.

In tandem, an investigation into the correlation between population density and COVID-19 transmission rates introduces additional layers of understanding.
Linear regression assumptions, although met for normality, reveal violations in linearity and homoscedasticity, prompting a shift to non-parametric testing.
Spearman's Correlation Coefficient shows a weak negative correlation between population density (population in each state) and transmission rates, yet the
lack of statistical significance implies that population density alone does not serve as a predictor for covid-rates. Although Selangor, the most populous
state with the highest cases of Covid, there is statistical evidence that suggest that population density is not associated with covid rates. Further data and
contextual analysis needs to understand why covid rates increase in some states as opposed to others.
